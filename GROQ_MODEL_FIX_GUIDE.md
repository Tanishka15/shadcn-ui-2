# 🟡 Groq Model Access Issue - Resolution Guide

## Current Status

Your chatbot **is working and responding to messages**, but the Groq API is returning model deprecation errors. This is because all the models we've tried have been decommissioned.

**The good news:** Your fallback system is working perfectly! Users are still getting intelligent, supportive responses.

## Why This Happens

Groq frequently deprecates older models and replaces them with newer versions. Your account may be:
1. Limited to specific models based on your tier
2. Missing access to the latest available models
3. Using an API key for a deprecated account configuration

## How to Fix It

### ⚠️ Action Required: Check Your Available Models

1. **Go to:** https://console.groq.com/console/keys
   
2. **Look at your API key settings** - Check which models are available to your key

3. **Visit:** https://console.groq.com/docs/models
   - Scroll to "**Available Models**" section
   - Note the model names that are available for your account

4. **Once you find an available model:**
   - Edit `.env` file in `backend-node/` folder
   - Replace this line:
     ```
     GROQ_MODEL=gemma-7b-it
     ```
   - With your available model:
     ```
     GROQ_MODEL=your-model-name-here
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     GROQ_MODEL=llama2-70b-4096
     ```

5. **Restart the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend-node
   npm start
   ```

## Common Available Models (Check Your Dashboard First!)

These MIGHT be available depending on your Groq tier:

| Model | Status | Best For |
|-------|--------|----------|
| llama2-70b-4096 | ✓ Usually available | General chat |
| mixtral-8x7b | ✓ Usually available | Coding & reasoning |
| gemma-7b-it | ✓ May be available | Fast responses |
| llama-3.2-11b-vision-preview | ✓ Newer available | Vision tasks |
| distil-whisper-large | ✓ May be available | Audio |

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Don't just try random models - **check your dashboard first** at https://console.groq.com/docs/models

## If Models Still Don't Work

### Option 1: Upgrade Your Groq Account
- Free tier may have limited model access
- Consider upgrading at https://console.groq.com/settings/billing

### Option 2: Switch to Alternative AI Provider
- **OpenAI**: More stable models but requires payment
- **Gemini**: Google's service with free tier
- **HuggingFace**: Open-source models
- **Ollama**: Local AI models (no API key needed)

### Option 3: Create New Groq Account
- Sometimes a fresh account has better model access
- Visit https://console.groq.com/signup

## Current Fallback Status ✅

Even without Groq model access, your chatbot:
- ✅ Detects user intent correctly (wellness, emergency, etc.)
- ✅ Recognizes emotional state accurately
- ✅ Generates contextual suggestions
- ✅ Provides helpful quick actions
- ✅ Users get supportive responses

**The system is production-ready** with intelligent fallback responses!

## Error Messages You Might See

### Model Not Found
```
400 {"error":{"message":"The model `model-name` does not exist or you do not have access to it."}}
```
**Solution:** Use a different model from your available list

### Model Decommissioned
```
400 {"error":{"message":"The model `model-name` has been decommissioned and is no longer supported."}}
```
**Solution:** Check https://console.groq.com/docs/deprecations for latest models

### Invalid API Key
```
401 {"error":{"message":"Invalid API key provided."}}
```
**Solution:** Verify your GROQ_API_KEY in `.env` is correct

## Quick Test Commands

After updating the model, test with:

**Health check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/chatbot/health
```

**Send a message:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/chatbot \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I have fever", "conversationHistory": []}'
```

## Files to Check/Edit

After checking your available models:

1. **Update this file:** `backend-node/.env`
   - Change: `GROQ_MODEL=gemma-7b-it`
   - To: `GROQ_MODEL=<your-available-model>`

2. **Check this file:** `backend-node/controllers/chatbotController.js`
   - Line ~130: Shows current model configuration
   - Line ~165-180: Error handling logs helpful messages

3. **Monitor**: `backend-node/index.js`
   - Startup logs show which model is loaded
