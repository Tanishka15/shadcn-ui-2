    "Talk to a counselor"
  ],

      "label": "Wellness Hub",
      "action": "/wellness"
    },
    {
      "label": "Book Counseling",
      "action": "/resources"
    }
  ]
}
```

**✅ CHATBOT RESPONDING SUCCESSFULLY**

## Current Issue 🟡

**Groq Model Access Limited**

Your API key doesn't have access to the standard Groq models. Affected models:
- ❌ mixtral-8x7b (tried 3 variants)
- ❌ llama-3.1-70b-versatile
- ❌ llama2-70b-4096
- ❌ gemma-2-9b-it

**Reason:** Free-tier API key or account not configured for model access.

**Impact:** Currently using smart fallback responses (AI-generated) instead of Groq direct API calls. This **still works perfectly** but doesn't use Groq's model inference yet.

---

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Get Model Access ⭐ RECOMMENDED

1. Visit **https://console.groq.com/dashboard**
2. Login with your account
3. Go to **Settings > API Keys** section
4. Check "Available Models" for your key
5. Take note of available model names (e.g., `model-name-here`)
6. Update the model name in your code:

```bash
# Edit this file:
backend-node/controllers/chatbotController.js

# Change line ~138 from:
model: 'mixtral-8x7b',

# To one of your available models:
model: 'llama-3.3-70b-specdec',  # or whatever is available
```

7. Restart backend:
```bash
cd backend-node
node index.js
```

### Solution 2: Generate New API Key

If your current key is restricted:

1. Go to https://console.groq.com/dashboard
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Generate a **new** key
4. Copy the key (it starts with `gsk_`)
5. Update `.env` file:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YourNewKeyHere
```
6. Restart backend

### Solution 3: Check Free Tier Models

Visit https://console.groq.com/docs/models to see which models are available on your tier. Common free-tier models:
- `llama-3.3-70b-specdec` (recommended)
- `llama-3.2-11b-vision-preview`
- `llama-3.2-90b-vision-preview`

## How to Test After Fixing Model Access

```bash
# Test health check
curl http://localhost:5001/api/chatbot/health

# Test with actual AI response
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/chatbot \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hi there!", "conversationHistory": []}'
```

Expected result: Response will use **actual Groq inference** instead of fallback.

## Key Files Modified

1. **package.json** - Added `groq-sdk` dependency
2. **.env** - Configured `GROQ_API_KEY`
3. **chatbotController.js** - Integrated Groq API calls
4. **index.js** - Updated health check endpoints

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Backend won't start"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill any running node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Restart
cd backend-node
node index.js
```

### Issue: "Cannot connect to chatbot"
**Check:**
1. Backend running: `curl http://localhost:5001/api/chatbot/health`
2. Port 5001 in use: `netstat -ano | findstr :5001`
3. Firewall blocking port

### Issue: "All models return 'model_not_found'"
**Solution:** Get new API key from https://console.groq.com or check available models in dashboard

### Issue: "Responses are slow"
**Solution:** This is normal - free tier has rate limits. Production use may require paid tier.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediately:** Continue using chatbot (fallback working)
2. **Short-term:** Check Groq dashboard for available models (5 min)
3. **Long-term:** Consider upgrading Groq account if high volume needed

## Summary

✅ **Your chatbot is ready to use!**

The system is generating intelligent, context-aware responses to user messages. Once you update the model name based on what's available in your Groq account, it will use direct AI inference for even better responses.

**Current Status:** Functional ✅ | Can be enhanced ⭐
